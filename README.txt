CA.Java:
This class is the gui class where I initialise the JFrame to the panel whilst using JComboBoxs for the user to enter their symptoms. The users entries are 
converted into strings so that they could be manipulated in other classes.

CAControl.java:
This class is my main class where the frame is created.

FileManager.java:
In this class this is where the MLdata excel sheet is opened and scanned. Using Apache poi I was able to open the sheet and count the data entries on the 
sheet. 

Naivebayes.java:
This class was meant for the NaiveBayes classifier to be implemented but I couldn't for the life of me figure out how. I used multiple online articles to try
understand how to implement it but after many days of being unsuccesful I have given up on it. 

Overall the program does launch and function but obviously doesnt include any AI as I wasn't able to do it. 
Could an example program please be provided after marking is done? I want to be able to learn from my mistakes rather than being given a poor grade and not be 
shown how to do it.
